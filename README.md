=============

eCard fundraising app for organizations and individuals.

Access the [demonstration site](http://ecards.meteor.com).

Basic usage
-----------
Users are presented with several images, and click an image to select it for their eCard. Then, the user will complete a form with the following information:

* their name
* their email
* friend's name
* friend's email
* message to friend
 
Once complete, the user will click 'send', and the eCard will be delivered to their friend's inbox.

Administration
--------------
Currently, basic administration is enabled at */admin*. This screen allows eCard images to be uploaded to the server. The images will also be created as database entries, so that the software can display them on the front-end.
